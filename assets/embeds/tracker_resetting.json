Instead of fetching a player's stats every `x` amount of time (in order to extrapolate historical stats), whenever a player's data is fetched from the *Hypixel API*, that data will simultaneously be used to reset historical stats. This approach will reset historical stats **__only if__** it has been the correct amount of time since the last reset."

This allows you to configure reset times based on your local time, regardless of your location.\n- Discord-based reset times take priority over player-based reset times.\n- When a Discord account changes its reset time, any linked player's reset time will update to match.\n- Players are automatically assigned a random reset hour when their historical tracking is initiated.\n- Player-based reset times are used if a Discord-based reset time is not configured",
